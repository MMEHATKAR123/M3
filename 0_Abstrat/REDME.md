 ABSTRACT <br>
  <h4>
 Over the past two decades, the automotive industry has aggressively researched ways to exploit modern computing and electronic advances in the development of safety, reliability, and entertainment technologies for vehicles. With drivers exposed to an ever increasing number of distractions, automatic rain-sensing wiper systems become an even more appealing feature, as they work to minimize the time the driver must take her hands off the wheel. Most traditional systems offer intermittent as well as variable speed operation. The traditional wiper system however requires driver constant attention in adjusting the wiper speed. Traditional windshield wiper speed constantly varies according to time and vehicle’s speed. Because the manual adjustment of the wiper distracts driver's attention, which may be a direct cause accidents. This is review paper for automatic wiper in various method and also explain the basic skeleton for adjust speed of wiper automatically cording to the amount of water on the windshield and in addition with also in advance removal of moisture inside the car while raining.

   INTRODUCTION<br>
    <h4>
    1)The team developed an autonomous windshield
wiper system for automobiles using IR and impedance
sensors, a microcontroller, and signal conditioning circuitry.
The sensors send an input signal to the microcontroller that
controls the wiper motor through interfacing with the
automobile wiper control circuitry. The motivation of the
project centered on developing a reliable automatic
windshield wiper system that is commercially available to a
large market of automobile owners. Research was done on
similar products in the market and articles from academic
sources for the foundation of our design approach.<br>
2) The project aims to develop an automatic windshield
wiper system that automates the process of the driver’s
manual response to rain on the windshield. Car
manufacturers will be the primary customers for system
integration into their future automobile lines, and the
secondary customers will be individual automobile owners,
using the system as an after-market product.<br>
3)The National Highway and Transportation Safety
Association reports that twenty-six percent of all car accidents
are caused by distractions due to talking on cell phones, eating
while driving, and other similar distractions that take a
driver’s focus off the road. The distraction considered in this
project is the adjustment of wiper speed based on the intensity
of precipitation falling. By eliminating the need for drivers to
adjust wiper speed while driving, the number of accidents
caused by distraction can be slightly reduced.<br>

      High Level Function Blocks<br>
      <h4>
       The rain detection box contains a series of rain
sensors. The data processing unit encloses the
microcontroller, and the motor control module is composed of
the wiper motor and its control circuit. After establishing the
functional diagram, a high level system block diagram was
drawn. The second diagram represents a more detailed
version of the functional diagram.depicts the contents
of each unit. The rain detection unit uses two types of sensors
whose outputs are normalized by an input signal module. The
data processing is performed by a microcontroller, and its
results are fed into an output signal module which is the input
to the motor control box. The two signal modules were
needed for interfacing between all the units.<br>
